face_detect.py — face-aware backdrop cropping.

When a landscape backdrop is cropped to a portrait poster, the hand-crafted
saliency heuristic can be fooled by large warm-toned, textured backgrounds
(e.g. a wooden bench / railings) and push the crop to an empty edge, slicing
the actual subject off.  A proper face detector is the robust signal for
"keep the people in frame".

Uses OpenCV's YuNet detector — accurate on small and profile faces, with a tiny
(~230 KB) ONNX model bundled in models/ (no runtime download).  If OpenCV or the
model are unavailable, face detection soft-disables and the caller falls back to
the saliency crop.

    Return [(centre_x, width, weight), …] for detected faces, where
    weight = score³ × area.

    Empty list when there are no faces or detection is unavailable.  Called from
    the thread pool (backdrop crop), so inference is serialised with _infer_lock.

    Why score is cubed rather than used linearly: YuNet occasionally throws a
    low-confidence "face" that's actually a large blurred blob in the
    background (a dark dresser / sofa cushions reading as a face-ish shape at
    just-above-_SCORE_THRESHOLD confidence).  Such a blob's bounding box can be
    2-3× the area of the genuine face elsewhere in frame, so a linear
    `score × area` lets it outrank — and the crop centres on empty background,
    slicing the actual subject almost entirely out of frame (observed in the
    wild on TMDB 450545 "Secret Santa", where a score=0.6/509×613px background
    blob beat the real score=0.9/293×482px face purely on size, landing the
    crop on a couch instead of the actress).  Cubing the score punishes
    borderline-confidence detections heavily enough that a genuine, confident
    face reliably wins regardless of the false positive's inflated bbox, while
    still letting bounding-box area break ties between two similarly-confident
    real faces (e.g. lead vs. background extra) as originally intended.
