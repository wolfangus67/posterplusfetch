"""Sync PostersPlus-rendered posters into a Plex Media Server library.

STANDALONE COMPANION SCRIPT — not part of the FastAPI service, not imported
by main.py, and not wired into the Docker image. Run it separately (locally,
on a schedule, however fits your workflow) against a running PostersPlus
instance and a reachable Plex Media Server.

Unlike Stremio (which fetches poster URLs lazily whenever it renders a
catalog), Plex has no "arbitrary URL, fetched live on render" mechanism —
artwork has to be *pushed* into its library via the API. That's what this
script does: for each movie/show in the configured libraries, it
  1. reads the IMDb/TMDB IDs Plex already has from its <Guid> metadata,
  2. derives real quality-badge tokens from the file's own media info
     (resolution / HDR / audio — see extract_quality_tokens), and
  3. fetches the rendered poster from PostersPlus and uploads it to Plex.

Why "real" quality info instead of AIOStreams: on Stremio, quality badges
answer "what's available to stream right now" (scraped from addons, before
you've played anything). On Plex you already own the file — its actual
resolution/HDR/codec is sitting right there in the library, more accurate
than anything a scraper could guess. PostersPlus already supports this via
a plain pass-through `quality=` override (see quality.parse_quality), so no
changes to the rendering pipeline were needed — only this adapter.

CAVEATS — read before trusting this against a big library:
  * The quality-token mapping in extract_quality_tokens() was written from
    a single sample <Stream> block, not validated against a live server.
    Different rips/encoders label things inconsistently (HDR vs HDR10 vs
    HDR10+, DTS-HD MA vs DTS:X, etc). ALWAYS run with --dry-run first and
    sanity-check the derived tokens against a handful of titles you know
    well before turning it loose on a whole library.
  * TV shows derive their quality tokens from a single representative episode
    (S01E01 by convention — the same rule Stremio's own quality badges use,
    per the user's request) rather than the show as a whole — see
    representative_episode(). A show spans many episodes that may genuinely
    differ in quality (e.g. a "complete series" folder assembled from rips of
    different eras/sources), so this is necessarily an approximation, not a
    single technically "correct" answer — same trade-off Stremio makes.
  * When extract_quality_tokens() legitimately finds NOTHING (older/lower-
    quality rips — e.g. a 720p file with no HDR/DV/source signals we
    recognise), build_poster_request() sends `quality=NONE` rather than
    omitting the param. This is intentional, not a typo: PostersPlus's
    /poster endpoint treats a *missing or empty* `quality=` as "go fetch one
    yourself" and falls back to its own AIOStreams/scraper-based lookup —
    which answers "what release is available to stream right now" and can be
    wildly higher quality than the user's actual file (confirmed: a 720p rip
    rendering with a gold "4K REMUX DV" badge because some 4K release of that
    title exists online somewhere). "NONE" is a non-empty string that isn't a
    recognised label in config.QUALITY_LABELS, so the server takes the
    explicit-override branch (skipping AIOStreams) and quality.parse_quality()
    discards it, yielding the empty token list we actually derived — at the
    cost of one harmless "unknown quality token ignored" warning server-side.
  * Plex may re-fetch and overwrite custom posters when its metadata agent
    refreshes an item. `item.uploadPoster()` (what this script calls) is the
    same call Plex Web's own "Upload Image" button makes, and that action is
    documented to LOCK the poster field — a locked field is explicitly
    skipped by metadata-agent refreshes, so a normal "Refresh Metadata" or
    scheduled library scan should leave your synced poster alone. What WILL
    blow it away: re-matching the item to different metadata ("Fix Match" /
    "Match"), removing and re-adding the title, or wiping/recreating the
    library — any of those effectively creates a new item and the lock (and
    this script's sync-state fingerprint) doesn't carry over. This hasn't
    been soak-tested over weeks against a live instance, so still keep an
    eye out and report back if posters revert unexpectedly.

Quick start — two ways to configure:
  1. Environment variables (shown below), or
  2. Open this file and fill in the "EASY CONFIG" block near the top
     (PLEX_BASE_URL_DEFAULT, PLEX_TOKEN_DEFAULT, etc.) so you don't have
     to export anything each time — env vars still override those defaults
     if both are set.

    pip install -r requirements-plex.txt
    export PLEX_BASE_URL="http://192.168.1.50:32400"
    export PLEX_TOKEN="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"      # see https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436
    export POSTERSPLUS_URL="http://localhost:8000"
    python plex_sync.py --dry-run --limit 5

POSTERSPLUS_URL also accepts a full recipe URL copied straight from the
configurator's "Copy URL" button — e.g.
    POSTERSPLUS_URL="http://localhost:8000/poster?bar_style=frosted&sash_badge_inset=0.000&..."
— in which case every one of those query parameters (gradients, bar/badge
styles, weighting profiles, everything) is applied as a default to every
synced poster. Only tmdb_id/imdb_id/type/quality/primary_client are always
computed per-item and override whatever the recipe URL says for those keys.
