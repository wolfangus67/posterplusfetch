"""Sync PostersPlus-rendered posters into a Jellyfin Media Server library.

STANDALONE COMPANION SCRIPT — not part of the FastAPI service, not imported
by main.py, and not wired into the Docker image. Run it separately (locally,
on a schedule, however fits your workflow) against a running PostersPlus
instance and a reachable Jellyfin server. This is the Jellyfin sibling of
plex_sync.py — same idea, same shape, ported to Jellyfin's REST API.

Unlike Stremio (which fetches poster URLs lazily whenever it renders a
catalog), Jellyfin has no "arbitrary URL, fetched live on render" mechanism —
artwork has to be *pushed* into its library via the API. That's what this
script does: for each movie/show in the configured libraries, it
  1. reads the IMDb/TMDB IDs Jellyfin already has from its ProviderIds,
  2. derives real quality-badge tokens from the file's own media info
     (resolution / HDR / audio — see extract_quality_tokens), and
  3. fetches the rendered poster from PostersPlus and POSTs it to Jellyfin's
     `/Items/{id}/Images/Primary` endpoint.

Why "real" quality info instead of AIOStreams: on Stremio, quality badges
answer "what's available to stream right now" (scraped from addons, before
you've played anything). On Jellyfin you already own the file — its actual
resolution/HDR/codec is sitting right there in the library, more accurate
than anything a scraper could guess. PostersPlus already supports this via
a plain pass-through `quality=` override (see quality.parse_quality), so no
changes to the rendering pipeline were needed — only this adapter.

No Jellyfin SDK dependency: this talks to Jellyfin's REST API directly with
plain httpx (the same library this script already uses to call PostersPlus,
and a core PostersPlus dependency already) — one less thing to install versus
plex_sync.py's `plexapi` requirement.

A structural advantage over the Plex version: Jellyfin's media-stream info
includes a `VideoRangeType` field that *directly* distinguishes HDR10 from
HDR10+ (and several Dolby-Vision-with-fallback combinations) — see
_VIDEO_RANGE_TO_TOKEN. Plex only exposes "this stream uses the PQ
(smpte2084) transfer function", which can't tell HDR10 and HDR10+ apart
(plex_sync.py documents that as a known under-detection risk). Jellyfin
doesn't have that particular blind spot.

CAVEATS — read before trusting this against a big library:
  * The quality-token mapping in extract_quality_tokens() was written from
    REST API documentation and source-code reading, NOT validated against a
    live server (the dev environment this was written in can't reach a real
    Jellyfin instance). Field names, casing, and exact VideoRangeType values
    may differ from what your server actually returns. ALWAYS run with
    --dry-run and --inspect first and sanity-check the derived tokens against
    a handful of titles you know well — exactly the same workflow that
    refined plex_sync.py's mapping against real Plex data. Report back what
    --inspect shows for a few titles and the mapping can be corrected the
    same way the Plex one was.
  * 4K/1080p detection is threshold-based on the primary video stream's
    Width/Height (Jellyfin doesn't expose a simple "2160"/"1080" resolution
    label the way Plex's `videoResolution` does) — see the constants near
    extract_quality_tokens(). Edge cases (anamorphic/odd aspect ratios,
    unusual encodes) may be misclassified; --inspect dumps the raw
    width/height so the thresholds can be tuned against real data.
  * REMUX/WEB-DL detection is the same best-effort text search plex_sync.py
    uses — regex over the file path AND the video stream's DisplayTitle/
    Title (organizing tools routinely strip source info from on-disk
    filenames, but Jellyfin — like Plex — often keeps the original
    scene-release name in the stream's embedded title metadata).
  * TV shows derive their quality tokens from a single representative episode
    (S01E01 by convention — same rule Stremio's own quality badges use, and
    the same rule plex_sync.py now follows) rather than the show as a whole.
    See representative_episode(). Necessarily an approximation — a show spans
    many episodes that may genuinely differ in quality.
  * When extract_quality_tokens() legitimately finds NOTHING, this sends
    `quality=NONE` to PostersPlus rather than omitting `quality=` — see the
    big comment in build_poster_request() for why (short version: PostersPlus
    treats a missing/empty `quality=` as "go fetch one from AIOStreams
    yourself", which answers "what's available to stream right now on the
    internet" and can produce wildly-too-generous badges for an old/low-
    quality local rip). This is a PostersPlus-side behaviour, not a
    Jellyfin-specific concern — the fix is identical to plex_sync.py's.
  * POSTER PERSISTENCE — this is the one place this script's behaviour is
    genuinely DIFFERENT from (and less certain than) plex_sync.py's, and is
    worth extra attention once you're testing against a live server:
    Plex's `uploadPoster()` is documented to LOCK the image field, so normal
    metadata refreshes leave it alone. Jellyfin's `POST /Items/{id}/Images/
    Primary` does NOT appear to carry the same guarantee — community reports
    describe custom images reverting after library/metadata refreshes unless
    the item's metadata is manually locked via the web UI (item → edit →
    padlock). This script deliberately does NOT try to lock anything via the
    API itself: Jellyfin's lock is a coarse, whole-item `LockData` flag (or a
    named `LockedFields` list) rather than a per-image lock, and flipping it
    automatically risks freezing fields you didn't mean to freeze (Overview,
    Genres, ProviderIds, ...) — too big a side effect for this script to take
    on your behalf. If you find posters reverting, lock them manually via the
    UI. Also note: this script's "unchanged, skip" state-fingerprint check has
    no way to detect a silent server-side revert — if Jellyfin quietly puts
    the old image back, the fingerprint still matches and the item is skipped.
    `--force` (or deleting the state file) is your escape hatch if that
    happens. Please report back what you see — this is the part of the
    Jellyfin port that most needs real-world validation.

Quick start — two ways to configure:
  1. Environment variables (shown below), or
  2. Open this file and fill in the "EASY CONFIG" block near the top
     (JELLYFIN_BASE_URL_DEFAULT, JELLYFIN_API_KEY_DEFAULT, etc.) so you don't
     have to export anything each time — env vars still override those
     defaults if both are set.

    pip install -r requirements-jellyfin.txt
    export JELLYFIN_BASE_URL="http://192.168.1.50:8096"
    export JELLYFIN_API_KEY="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"   # Dashboard -> Advanced -> API Keys
    export POSTERSPLUS_URL="http://localhost:8000"
    python jellyfin_sync.py --dry-run --limit 5

POSTERSPLUS_URL also accepts a full recipe URL copied straight from the
configurator's "Copy URL" button — e.g.
    POSTERSPLUS_URL="http://localhost:8000/poster?bar_style=frosted&sash_badge_inset=0.000&..."
— in which case every one of those query parameters (gradients, bar/badge
styles, weighting profiles, everything) is applied as a default to every
synced poster. Only tmdb_id/imdb_id/type/quality/primary_client are always
computed per-item and override whatever the recipe URL says for those keys.
